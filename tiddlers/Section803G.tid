Should any budget fail to gain final approval prior to the beginning of the new Fiscal Year, the Town must implement a substitute for any such failed budget at the beginning of the Fiscal Year pursuant to General Statutes sections 7-405 and 12-123 and the court cases decided thereunder, and in the case of the Board of Education budget, in compliance with the Minimum Budget Requirement (MBR) of State law. If the Board of Selectmen is legally required to set a mill rate, it may do so only after considering the timely advice of the Board of Finance.
