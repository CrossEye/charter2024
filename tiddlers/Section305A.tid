Two percent (2%) of the electors of the Town, as determined by the latest official registry lists of the Registrar of Voters, may at any time, on a form provided by the Town Clerk, petition over their signature for a Petitioned Town Meeting concerning such matters provided for in Section 304C (except to the extent that acquisition by purchase is contemplated by the petition), <<Section 304D>>, <<Section 304H>> and <<Section 304>>) of this Charter. Any such proposal shall be examined by the Town Attorney before being submitted to a Petitioned Town Meeting. He shall be authorized to correct the proposal for repetitions, illegalities and unconstitutional provisions, but he may not materially change its meaning or effect. This section shall not derogate the right of the electors to petition for a Special Town Meeting as otherwise provided in Connecticut General Statutes.
