At its first meeting following each biennial Town Election, the Board of Selectmen shall fix a time and place of its regular meeting and provide a method for the calling of special meetings. At this meeting, the Board, by a majority vote of the entire membership, shall select a Vice-First Selectman, who shall act in the absence or temporary disability of the Chairman First Selectman. In the event a vote for the Vice-First Selectman is not taken at the first meeting, such Vice-First Selectman must be chosen at the next meeting at which a quorum of the entire Board is present. The Board of Selectmen shall, by resolution, determine its own rules of procedure, except that each Selectman shall be able to make a motion or offer a proposal which shall be considered by the Board of Selectmen without the necessity of a seconding motion. All meetings of the Board of Selectmen for the transaction of business shall be open to the public, except that the Board of Selectmen may stand in executive session whenever otherwise permitted by law. The votes of each member shall be recorded at the session at which they occur and reported in the minutes of such meeting. The majority of the entire Board of Selectmen shall constitute a quorum, and no ordinance, resolution, or action except a vote to adjourn or fix the time and place of the next meeting shall be adopted by less than a majority of the entire Board of Selectmen.
