The Board of Finance, in consultation with the Capital Improvement Plan Committee and the Board of Selectmen, shall establish and maintain written purchasing procedures and policies which include, but are not limited to, time lines and procedures for submission of Capital equipment purchase requests to the Board of Finance. All Town departments, boards, and agencies, except the | local Board of Education, shall adhere to these procedures and policies, as modified.

Upon the authorization of a query or investigation approved by a majority of those CIP members voting, the Capital Improvement Plan Committee and/or its designees shall have full and unfettered access to any and all Town capital equipment records (including but not limited to maintenance records) as they directly relate to the purchase, maintenance, and/or upkeep of current or proposed town-owned or leased capital equipment.

Refusal by any town department, agency or its designee to provide full and unfettered access as noted above or to adequately respond to CIP requests for further information necessary for the CIP Committee to reach a determination in its research, shall empower the CIP Committee to issue a summary dismissal of the town department, agency and/or its designees request for approval of the Capital Equipment purchase or lease. The Board of Finance shall not be empowered to approve any request that has been summarily dismissed as noted above, until such time that a majority of the voting members of the CIP Committee void or revoke the aforementioned dismissal, or the summary dismissal has been repealed by a unanimous vote of both the entire Board of Selectmen and a unanimous vote by the entire voting membership of the Board of Finance.
